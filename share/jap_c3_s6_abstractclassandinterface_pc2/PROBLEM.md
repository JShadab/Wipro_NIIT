## Practice Statement - Furniture Mart

**The Furniture and Fittings Company (FFC) manufactures office, garden and home furniture. Recently, more and more companies are encouraging their employees to work from home. The global trend has benefitted FFC by increasing the sales, especially of their office furniture. The customers can shop and place orders online. They can provide their specifications for the desired furniture item such as  color, type of furniture  and material. FFC gives a discount of 10% for the office furniture, 5% for the home furniture, 2.5% for the garden furniture.**

**Develop a Java program that accepts the specification of the furniture and the price, calculates the discounted price of the furniture and displays the information to the customer. The program displays the actual price and the discounted price of the furniture.**

**Hint :**
1. Use an Interface for
    - Defining the discounted price of each type of furniture.
    - Declaring common methods such as calculateDiscount and displayFurnitureDetails that will be used by the subclasses.
2. In an implementation class
    - Create appropriate constructors and call the methods.
    - Ensure that the superclass refers to subclass types
3. The Furniture Type can be implemented as an Enum or a set of string constants (HOME, GARDEN, OFFICE)
4. The discounted price cannot be modified by other classes. Ensure this by using access specifiers.
